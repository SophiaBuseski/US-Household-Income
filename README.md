# US-Household-Income
US Household Income SQL Analysis Project

## Project Overview 
In this project, I conducted a detailed analysis of cost of living and salary data with the primary goal of cleaning and exploring the dataset to uncover significant patterns and correlations. The data, provided in an Excel spreadsheet, was analyzed using Excel for initial data handling and SQL for more in-depth exploration and analysis.

## Objective 
The main aim was to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis to understand the relationship between the cost of living in various municipalities and the corresponding salary levels.

## Data 
- Excel Dataset [See It!](https://github.com/SophiaBuseski/US-Household-Income/blob/main/USHouseholdIncome.csv)

- Excel Dataset 2 [See It!](https://github.com/SophiaBuseski/US-Household-Income/blob/main/USHouseholdIncome_Statistics.csv)
  
- Data Cleaning and Exploration Code [See It!](https://github.com/SophiaBuseski/US-Household-Income/blob/main/US%20HouseHold%20Income%20Data%20Cleaning%20and%20Ex.%20Done.sql)

## Methodology 
  ### 1. Data Cleaning: 
  The project began with a thorough data cleaning process to address inconsistencies, handle missing values, and ensure
  the data was accurate and reliable for analysis.
  
 ### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
 Using SQL queries, I explored the dataset to identify key trends and correlations, focusing on the relationship between
 salary levels and the cost of living in different areas.
 
  ### 3. Outlier Filtering: 
  I filtered out outlier data entries, such as municipalities with only one entry, to focus on higher-volume data for a 
  more accurate analysis of trends.
  

## Key Findings 
 ### 1. Cost of Living and Salary Correlation: 
 Areas with a high cost of living also tend to have high average salaries. Most salary averages in these areas are close to the median, indicating a relatively
 consistent salary distribution within high-cost regions.

 ### 2. Outliers and Data Filtering: 
 Certain data points, such as single entries for municipalities, CDPs, and counties, were identified as outliers and filtered out to improve the accuracy of the
 analysis.

 ### 3. High Salary Cities: 
 Cities with the highest average salaries had a salary cap around $300,000. These cities are likely some of the most expensive places to live.

 ### 4. Socio-Economic Insights: 
 The analysis revealed significant differences in salary levels across different types of communities, with urban areas typically showing dramatically lower
 salaries compared to high-cost living areas.
  
## Impact 
The insights from this project are valuable for understanding the socio-economic landscape of different regions. Businesses, policymakers, and researchers can use these findings to:

  - Assess the economic viability of different regions.
  - Develop strategies for addressing income disparities.
  - Plan for socio-economic initiatives that target high-cost living areas with appropriate salary adjustments.
    
By leveraging SQL for detailed data exploration and analysis, this project demonstrates the importance of robust data handling and analytical skills in deriving actionable insights from complex datasets. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how salary levels correlate with the cost of living across various regions, providing a foundation for informed decision-making in socio-economic planning and policy development.
